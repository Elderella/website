## Pricing FAQ

**What happens after 7 days?**
You choose. When you sign up, you'll get full access to Plus for 7 days. On Day 7, you can subscribe to Plus or Premium to keep all the features, or continue using Elderella for free with our Free plan — no payment required. Your care information stays safe regardless of which plan you choose.

**How does the "per elder" pricing work?**
You pay based on how many elders you're caring for. Each elder needs their own profile. Your own profile is always free, and care team members don't pay separately.

**How do I upgrade, downgrade, or cancel?**
You can change your plan anytime in the app under Settings > Subscription. Upgrades take effect immediately. Downgrades take effect at your next billing date. Cancel anytime with no penalties — you'll move to the Free plan.

**What will happen if I downgrade my subscription?**
Your care information is not deleted. Care memory beyond 90 days won't be accessible but isn't gone. Voice notes and extra care team members are preserved within your new plan's limits. You can upgrade again anytime.

**Do care team members need to pay separately?**
No. Care team members are included in your plan at no extra cost. Only the account owner managing the elder's profile pays.

**Can we change who is paying for an elder?**
Yes. The current subscriber makes the new person a "Primary Caregiver," downgrades to Free, and the new Primary Caregiver subscribes to a paid plan. Care memory and team stay intact.

**What happens to my information if I cancel?**
Your information stays safe. When you cancel, you move to the Free plan. If you want to delete your account entirely, visit the [delete account page](/delete-account).
