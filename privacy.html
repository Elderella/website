Although this information will not identify you personally, it nevertheless provides certain information about you, and we therefore will not use it in a non-confidential manner unless it is fully anonymized. Additionally, use of Elderella's website and/or Services may result in the collection of technical information such as your computer's IP address, operating system, browser name/version, the referring web page, requested page, date/time, and sometimes a "cookie" (which can be disabled using your browser preferences); such information is used to help us understand the overall usage pattern of our website and Services.

This includes any third party documentation relating to the Elder. For any Elders that do not have the legal capacity to provide consent to such disclosure and use of personal information, you must ensure that you have the appropriate consents from the Elder's guardian, person holding the appropriate power of attorney, or other legal representative with the authority to provide such consents. For any Elders that are minors, Elderella expects parents or guardians to be the primary contact with respect to any use of Services obtained through Elderella; personal information of any minor must not be disclosed except with the parent's or guardian's consent. Further details are set forth in the section below, "Information relating to minors".

                            Elderella Services are designed to be provided to and used by adults, and not children. We do not collect or retain any personal information from children. Elderella Services and content on its website are not directed at children under 18 years of age, and Elderella does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information directly from children under 18 years of age online. For purposes of using the Services respecting a minor, parents or guardians may supply information respecting their children just as they would an Elder; however, Elderella expects the parent or guardian to be at all times the party supervising and responsible for such child's use of Elderella Services, if any, and to solely be controlling the information disclosed respecting such child.

If you have any questions respecting your personal information and how it's being used, you need only ask us, and we will answer.</li>
                            <li><strong>Limitations of purpose:</strong> We will limit use of your personal information to the extent necessary to provide you with our Services, with the clear exceptions that are set out in this Privacy Policy</li>
                            <li><strong>Minimization of data:</strong> We only collect personal information that we need, and that you choose to give to us. We will not collect personal information gratuitously from you for no reason.</li>
                            <li><strong>Accuracy:</strong> We make reasonable efforts to keep your personal information accurate and up to date, based on your input; if you notify us of any changes to your personal information, we will make sure to change it in our systems in a timely manner.</li>
                            <li><strong>Limitation of data retention:</strong> We believe in streamlining the way that we handle personal information so that it minimizes data redundancy and unnecessary retention.

                            <li><strong>Integrity and confidentiality:</strong> We process your personal information using appropriate technical or organizational measures designed to ensure appropriate security of your personal information, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.</li>

Additionally, if there are any disclosure or use restrictions in your consent to the collection of your personal information, Elderella will abide by those restrictions (subject to the consent exceptions listed in this Privacy Policy). For example, your credit card or financial information will only be used to bill you for the services that you have authorized or used, or to pay you for the services performed, as applicable.
