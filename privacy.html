            <li><strong>Non-PHI Data Licensing:</strong> We may license access to aggregated, de-identified, non-Protected Health Information (non-PHI) data to third parties for research, analysis, or commercial purposes. Such data will not include any information that could reasonably identify you or any specific individual</li>

        <h2>5. Data Security and Storage</h2>
        <p>
            We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, 
            alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, 
            and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>
        
        <h3>5.1 Data Storage Location</h3>
        <p>
            Your health information and personal data are securely stored on Google Cloud servers located in Montreal, Canada. 
            While stored outside the United States, your data remains protected under our Business Associate Agreement with Google Cloud
            and all applicable privacy requirements. Canadian privacy laws, including PIPEDA, provide strong protections for your information.
            Canadian authorities may have access to data stored in Canada under Canadian law.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your personal data may also be processed by other trusted third-party service providers (such as Calendly and Attio), which may
            store data in the United States or other jurisdictions. We take steps to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place when
            information is transferred internationally.
        </p>

            to delete that information.
        </p>

        <h2>7. International Data Transfers</h2>
        <p>
            Your information may be transferred to and processed in countries other than your country of residence. These countries may have 
            data protection laws different from those in your country. We will ensure appropriate safeguards are in place to protect your 
            personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
        </p>
