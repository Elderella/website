# Introducing Elderella

> Tips and conversation starters for family caregivers introducing Elderella to their elders. Build comfort and consent around using caregiving technology.

Introducing a new caregiving resource might be challenging. The tips below will help you explain what Elderella is, why you're using it, and how it supports everyone involved.

## A note for elders

If you're the one receiving care, welcome. A person caring for you would like to use Elderella to keep track of your appointments, medications, tasks, and care updates so they can support you better.

Elderella helps organize information but you decide:
- What gets included and what doesn't
- Who can see the information
- Whether you want to use Elderella yourself or have the person caring for you manage it

Your information stays private and secure. It's only shared with the people you, and the person caring for you, agree on. You can change your mind anytime.

## Building comfort and consent

Some elders may want to use Elderella with you, others may prefer you just keep them informed. Both approaches are fine as long as the person you're caring for understands how their information will be used and feels comfortable giving their consent.

1. **Be transparent.** Explain what you'll add (events, tasks, medications, notes) and why.
2. **Start small.** Begin with one or two things that clearly help, like tracking medications or doctor visits.
3. **Let them set boundaries.** Ask what they're comfortable including and who should see it. Consent is ongoing.
4. **Show value quickly.** Point out when Elderella helps avoid confusion or a missed appointment.
5. **Reassure they have control.** Remind them they can always ask questions, change settings, or adjust what's included.

## Conversation starters you can use

**"It will help me stay organized."**
For elders who are independent but you're managing a lot behind the scenes. Reassures them the tool supports you, not controls them.

**"It will keep us connected."**
For shared caregiving among family members. Emphasizes teamwork and communication rather than surveillance.

**"It's really simple."**
For elders who get overwhelmed by details or dislike apps. Focuses on simplicity and more time together.

**"Your privacy matters."**
For elders who worry about data and technology. Explain that only chosen people can see what's added, and offer to show the privacy policy.

**"Let's try it together."**
For curious or involved elders. Do a simple task side-by-side to make the experience approachable and shared.
