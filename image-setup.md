# Image Setup Instructions

Since I cannot directly extract images from screenshots, you'll need to:

1. Save the hero hug image (from your first screenshot - the women embracing) as:
   `/Users/mike/elderella/website/images/hero-hug.jpg`

2. Save the hands together image (from your second screenshot - stacked hands) as:
   `/Users/mike/elderella/website/images/hands-together.jpg`

You can do this by:
- Right-clicking on each image in the screenshot
- Select "Save Image As..."
- Save to the images folder with the correct name

The website is already configured to display these images once they're in place.
