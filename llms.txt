# Elderella

> Elderella is a mobile app that helps family caregivers organize elder care, share responsibilities, and manage the mental load of caring for aging loved ones.

Elderella turns everyday elder care updates into organized care you can rely on. Chat with Ella, your AI caregiving partner, to capture care details as they happen. She remembers what you and your care team share, and automatically detects and creates events, tasks, medication entries, and care team members. Available on Android (iOS coming soon).
