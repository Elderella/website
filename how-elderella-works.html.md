# How Elderella works

> Discover how Elderella helps family caregivers organize care, share responsibilities, and manage medications with Ella, your caregiving partner.

Elderella turns everyday elder care updates into organized care you can rely on. From conversations and notes, Elderella creates tasks, calendar events, care briefings and plans, and up-to-date medication lists your care team can act on, turning the chaos in your head into calm, coordinated care.

## Ella, your caregiving partner

### Step 1: Add Ella to your care conversations

Add Ella as a contact and include her in your caregiving group chats. When you share updates about appointments, medications, or care tasks, Ella listens and learns.

### Step 2: Elderella collects care details

Ella automatically detects and organizes care information from your conversations. Medications, appointments, tasks, and care team members are captured without any extra effort.

### Step 3: Ella remembers and reminds

Ask Ella anything about your loved one's care. She remembers medications, appointments, and preferences so you don't have to. Get gentle reminders before important events.

Invite family, friends, and professionals to your care team. Everyone stays informed with the right level of access, and tasks can be delegated without endless phone calls.
