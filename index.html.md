# Turn chaos into care.

> Elderella turns everyday elder care updates into organized care you can rely on.

## Do your last solo shift.

Elderella brings structure, memory, and support by organizing the chaos, remembering the details, and building your elder care team.

## You're not alone.

- **71+ million** North Americans caring for aging loved ones
- **26 hours** average time spent providing care per week
- **$600+ billion** annual value of unpaid family caregiving

## Your caregiving partner

Chat with Ella to capture care details as they happen. She remembers what you (and your care team) share and automatically detects and creates events, tasks, medication entries, and care team members so you don't have to.

## Share responsibility

Invite family, friends, and professionals so everyone on the care team is visible in one place. Set clear roles and permissions to control exactly what each person can see, and delegate tasks without disclosing private details.

## Quickly capture, store & search

Have all your caregiving information at your fingertips, without paper, binders, or digging. Record what's happening while you're attending an appointment, or walking back to your car, instead of trying to remember it all later.

## Know "all the meds"

Just take a photo of the label (try it!) so you don't have to type everything in. Elderella auto-corrects medication names, sets reminders down to the hour, and can notify your care team about changes so everyone knows what's current.

## Remember everything

Elderella brings tasks and events together into one shared, caregiving-focused view, with assignable to-dos, recurring schedules, and gentle reminders so everyone knows what's coming up, who's doing what, and nothing slips through the cracks.

## Keep on top of elder care

Elderella is for families supporting elders. Built to help you organize care, share information, and ease the mental load of caregiving.
