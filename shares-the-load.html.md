# Help for family caregivers

> Learn how Elderella helps you share caregiving responsibilities with your care team. Coordinate care, delegate tasks, and control access levels.

Elderella turns caregiving information into a coordinated care team.

## Features

### Identify care team

Elderella spots people in your texts and notes and suggests them as care team members, so you can add them with a tap.

### Invite care team

Add someone with just a name and phone number, pick their role and access level, and Elderella sends a friendly text invite.

### Care team information

See your whole care team on one screen, grouped by access level, with tap-to-call or email so you're not hunting through contacts.

### Delegate & remind

Assign tasks and events, set due dates and reminders, and Elderella nudges people — and prompts for notes after visits — to keep the care story fresh.

### Care team access levels

Choose from five access levels so each person only sees what they need, whether they're a primary caregiver, helper, or professional.

### Set what care team sees

Mark any note, task, or event as "primary caregiver only," and choose who gets medication alerts, so you stay in control of what's shared.
