## Prompt

```
Design a single-column email template for Elderella, a caregiving app. This is a welcome
email sent to new users within 1 hour of signing up.

BRAND IDENTITY:
- Brand name: Elderella (with a small purple sparkle/star accent on the "ll")
- Color palette: white (#FFFFFF) background, soft lavender/purple (#EFEEFC), periwinkle
  blue for CTA buttons / links / strength (#5A4FCF), coral for fun (#DC607A), dark
  charcoal (#595959) for body text
- Typography: Merriweather Sans for headlines, Source Sans Pro for body text
- Decorative elements: small purple and/or gold four-pointed sparkle/star accents
  scattered sparingly
- Overall feel: calm, warm, breathing room, like a quiet moment with a cup of tea. NOT
  clinical, NOT corporate. Think cozy blanket, not hospital brochure.

DESIGN DIRECTION:
- The audience is overwhelmed family caregivers. The design should feel like a deep breath.
  Generous whitespace. Soft edges. Rounded corners on all buttons and cards. Nothing
  aggressive or urgent.
- Use warm, muted tones. Avoid harsh contrasts.
- Rounded periwinkle blue CTA buttons with white text, no shadow
- Light lavender sections to break up content blocks
- Small, simple line-art icons next to the two action items (a chat bubble icon for the
  group chat option, a microphone icon for the capture option)
- No hero image -- keep it text-forward and clean, with whitespace as the primary design
  element
- Email width: 600px max, with 40px padding on each side

LAYOUT (top to bottom):

1. HEADER: Elderella logo (left-aligned) small and understated. No navigation links.

2. GREETING BLOCK (white background):
   "Hi [Name]," in serif font, warm charcoal color.

   Body text in sans-serif, regular weight, ~20px, generous line-height (1.5):
   "Ella is ready to start helping. She's good at remembering the things you don't have
   room to hold right now -- the medications, the appointments, the details that slip
   through the cracks when life gets loud."

3. PREMIUM BANNER (soft cream/beige rounded card with no border):
   "You have full Premium access for 7 days. Use Elderella each day this week, and we'll
   double it to 14."
   -- Set in slightly emphasized text (medium weight), centered.

4. SECTION LABEL:
   "Pick whatever feels useful right now:" in Source Sans Pro font, medium size.

5. ACTION CARD 1 (white card with very light lavender left border, rounded corners, subtle
   shadow):
   Icon: small chat bubble line icon in periwinkle
   Title (semi-bold, Source Sans Pro): "Add Ella to your family group chat"
   Body: "If your family already has a text thread about caregiving, add Ella. She'll start
   picking up appointments, medications, and care details from the conversation -- no extra
   work from anyone."

6. ACTION CARD 2 (same card style):
   Icon: microphone icon in purple
   Title (semi-bold, Source Sans Pro): "Capture something before it disappears"
   Body: "Open a chat, type a quick note, record a voice memo, or snap a photo. A
   medication. An appointment. Something the doctor said last week. Ella will have it ready
   when you actually need it."

7. CTA BUTTON (centered):
   Rounded periwinkle with white text: "See what your first minute with Ella looks like"

8. CLOSING (white background):
   "One small action today. That's all it takes." -- in Merriweather Sans, slightly larger,
   centered. This is the emotional anchor of the email.

   Then: "-- The Elderella Team", left-aligned.

9. P.S. LINE:
   "P.S. -- You can also sync your calendar so Ella sees upcoming appointments
   automatically." with "sync your calendar" as a purple underlined text link.

10. FOOTER: Minimal. Muted gray text, small font. Unsubscribe link, company address.
    Elderella logo mark (just the sparkle) centered above footer text.

IMPORTANT STYLE NOTES:
- Everything should feel spacious. Err on the side of too much whitespace.
- Text should feel conversational, not designed. Like a thoughtful note, not a marketing
  blast.
- No stock photography. No gradients. No shadows.
- The two action cards should feel like gentle suggestions, not demands.
- The periwinkle CTA button should be the only bold color pop in the entire email.

Output a complete, polished email template design as a single image at 600px width.

## Tips for Adapting This Prompt

- **For a different email**: Replace the text in the LAYOUT section but keep sections 1-10 as the structural template.
- **To add an image**: Replace "No hero image" in Design Direction with a description of the image you want (e.g., "Soft watercolor illustration of hands holding a cup of tea").
- **If text renders poorly**: Regenerate or try Nano Banana Pro for better text fidelity.
