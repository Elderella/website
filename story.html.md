# Built alongside family caregivers

> Share your elder care story with Elderella. Help us build better support for family caregivers by sharing your experiences.

From the very beginning.

We've conducted 80+ in-depth interviews (and counting) with family caregivers across Canada, the US, and the UK. These conversations help us understand where caregiving really breaks down, how Elderella can help, and where we should focus our efforts.

Elderella's mission is to make family caregiving more sustainable and less isolating by turning scattered care details into a shared, accessible "caregiver memory" that helps families coordinate care with confidence.

In December 2025, we launched our alpha product with family caregivers using Elderella in their real lives. Elderella continues to be shaped by daily realities and lived experience.
