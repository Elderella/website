Elderella collects caregiving information from everywhere and everyone.

## Features

### Your elder's story

Answer one simple question a day and Elderella quietly builds a rich, searchable story about your elder and what they need.

### Everyday chats

Chat with Ella on the go and Elderella will tuck everything into your elder's growing care story so you don't have to remember it all.

### Everyday notes & docs

Add voice, photo, or text notes, or documents, and Elderella will add them all to your elder's care story so nothing important gets lost.

### Event updates

Add a quick update after an appointment or visit, keeping everyone in the loop while Elderella folds it into your elder's care story.

### Medication updates

Scan a pill pack or prescription label, and Elderella will quickly add medications for you — no typing, no guessing.

### You decide what to add

Anything Elderella or your care team enters goes through you first. A handy "Needs Your Review" list lets you quickly approve or skip each item before it's added to the care story.
