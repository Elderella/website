# Help for family caregivers

> Learn how Elderella helps you remember and find caregiving information quickly. Manage multiple elders, see upcoming care needs, and get medication reminders.

Elderella makes caregiving information easy to find, fast.

## Features

### Manage multiple elders

Keep all your elders in one place, and easily switch between their profiles without losing track of who needs what when.

### Know what's next

Your "What's Next" view shows the most pressing tasks and closest events at a glance, so you can stop wondering what you're forgetting.

### See upcoming care needs

Sync your calendar and let Elderella line up visits, reminders, and follow-ups so you can see what's coming before it hits. Elderella only syncs events related to your elder.

### Ask Ella

Ask Ella for what you need — "When was Dad's last fall?" or "What changed this week?" — and she'll pull the answer from the care story in seconds.

### Get care team updates

Get a simple, scrollable digest of everything your care team has done: notes, tasks, visits, and changes. Catch up in seconds instead of piecing it together.

### Medication information

Open the meds tab to see a clean, current list of medications, doses, and schedules, so you're never scrambling to remember. Set reminders so you never miss a dose.
